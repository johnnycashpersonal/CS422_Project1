# Initial Project Plan & SDS

### Project Plan
*Manu*
- A management plan. How is your team organized? How is the work divided among team members? How does your team make decisions? How will your team meet and how will it communicate.
- Work breakdown schedule (with > 10 milestones) and project schedule (who will do what).
- Monitoring and reporting: How individual and project progress will be monitored to keep track of who did what and when did they do it?

*John*
- A build plan. What is the sequence of steps you will take to build the system? When will each "build" of the system take place
- A rationale for the build plan. Why have you broken the system into these parts, and why have you chosen these particular steps to build the system? What are your risks and your risk reduction strategies?

### SDS
*Myles*
- A description of the product you intend to build. This should describe the externally visible behavior of your product as precisely as possible, but it should be concise and clear.
- An overall design description. What are the major parts of your system, and how do they fit together?
- System structure is clear.

*Tim*
- Each major subsystem should be explained using a separate static model and dynamic model. All diagrams must be clear and understandable.
- Design Rationale. Why did you chose this particular design? What are the main organizing principles that you used to break your system into parts?
